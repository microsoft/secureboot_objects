# This workflow call is responsible for building the secure boot binaries and
# uploading them as a build artifact. This is for PR Checks.
#
# If the workflow call is triggered by a release, (i.e. a tag push), then it
# will additionally archive them (zip, tar.gz) and upload the archives to the
# release as an asset.
#
# NOTE: The GITHUB_TOKEN is used by the action-gh-release@v1 action to upload
#       the archives to the release, and thus must have Read and Write
